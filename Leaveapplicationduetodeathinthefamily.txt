 Leave application due to death in the family



Subject: Leave required due to death in the family

Dear $auth_gen $auth_name,

I am writing this letter to inform you about the unfortunate and unexpected passing away of my $relation on $day. I intend to be out for the funeral and related arrangements until $e_date.

I request you to grant me $period days of emergency leaves because of such circumstances. 

I trust that my work over the last few years speaks for itself about my willingness to make all endeavors to catch up satisfactorily upon my return. I am confident that my current unfinished tasks will not be negatively affected by this short absence. 

Once I return to the office on $r_date, I hope to be able to concentrate on my work much more effectively. 

Thank you for your support during this time. 

Yours sincerely, 
$name
