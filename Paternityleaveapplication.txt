Paternity leave application


Subject: Paternity leave application

Dear $auth_gen $auth_name,

I am writing this letter to let you know that my wife is in the final stage of her pregnancy and the due date is fast approaching. 

Since this is going to be our $baby baby, I am way too excited to see my child and desire to be with her during the delivery and a couple of weeks post the delivery. 

As we stay alone and my parents are going to join us in a few weeks, I request you to grant me leave for $period days, beginning from the $s_date. 

I have transferred the important duties to my associate $p'gen $p'sname, and $p'gen $p'sname will look after the tasks until I get back to work. 

I hope you understand my situation and authorize my paternity leave as soon as possible. 

Thanks and regards, 
$name
