Maternity leave application

Subject: Maternity leave application

Dear Mr. G, 

I hope that this letter finds you in the best of health. This letter concerns my request regarding maternity leave from 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-07. It is going to be a 3 days leave, and I will rejoin soon after that. 

As I am going to be away for a very long time, I have authorized Mr. G to take over my responsibilities. Mr. G has courteously agreed to take over my chair for 3 days.

I have attached my medical certificate, along with other important details, required to avail the leave. 

I also request you to give me the information of the hospital covered under the office insurance coverage so that a part of my medical expenses is taken care of. 

 In the case of an emergency, I can be reached at @ 9876543210. 

Yours Sincerely, 
G
