Subject: Leave application for family vacation

Dear Mr. G,

I am writing to request your approval for a 3 day leave for my planned vacation. I would like to take my vacation during the Winter from 2020-01-09 to 2020-01-16 to take a trip through the G with family.

I feel incredibly confident that the rest of the team should be able to continue excellent work during my absence. 

I look forward to your response and also thank you for your consideration. 

Yours sincerely,
G
