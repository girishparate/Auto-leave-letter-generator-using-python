Maternity leave application

Subject: Maternity leave application

Dear $auth_gen $auth_name, 

I hope that this letter finds you in the best of health. This letter concerns my request regarding maternity leave from $s_date to $e_date. It is going to be a $period days leave, and I will rejoin soon after that. 

As I am going to be away for a very long time, I have authorized $p'sgen $p'sname to take over my responsibilities. $p'sgen $p'sname has courteously agreed to take over my chair for $period days.

I have attached my medical certificate, along with other important details, required to avail the leave. 

I also request you to give me the information of the hospital covered under the office insurance coverage so that a part of my medical expenses is taken care of. 

 In the case of an emergency, I can be reached at $email $contact. 

Yours Sincerely, 
$name
