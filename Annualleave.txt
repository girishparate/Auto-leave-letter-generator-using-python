Dear Mr. G, 

I am writing this letter to let you know that I am in need of a long-term leave. Thus, I would like to avail my full annual leave allotment as I have my complete yearly leave allowance. 

I request you to consider my leave application of 3 days as I am G. I would like to avail the leaves from 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-02. 

I have delegated my current project to Mr. G. Mr. G very well understands about my project and is capable of handling the task without any difficulties. 

During the days of my absence from office, I can be reached at @ or 9876543210.

I will return to the office on 2020-01-03. In case I want to resume the work sooner or later than the stated date, I will let you know well in advance.  

Yours Sincerely,
